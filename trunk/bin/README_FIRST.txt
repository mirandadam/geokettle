
Welcome to Pentaho Data Integration!
-------------------------------------

Thank you for using our software.

To get started, look in the [docs/English] directory for the file [Spoon_3_0_0_User_Guide.pdf].
In it, you'll find an installation description and a user manual for the graphical editor Spoon.

Basically, what it comes down to is:

1) Download/Install Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or higher. (also known as Java 5)
2) Run "Spoon.bat" on Windows, "sh spoon.sh" on Unix or OSX.

As you will note, the graphical job editor Chef is no longer present as a separate program.
All functionality that was in Chef (and then some) is taken over by Spoon.

If you are looking for sample transformations and jobs, you will be pleased to know that there are a bunch of these in the samples/ directory.

We really hope you will find Pentaho Data Integration useful in your daily work.

Best regards,

The development team.
